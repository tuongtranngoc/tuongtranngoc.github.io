## Introduction
Object Detection consists of two sub-tasks: Object Localization and Object Classification. The common goal of object localization is to determine coordinates of objects in the picture .

Bounding box regression is crucial step to determine objects. In existing methods, the common cost functions of bounding box regression are used by $l_n-norm$ distance and IoU for evaluating metric. Currently, IoU loss, GIoU loss, DIoU loss, ... have been proposed to benefit the IoU metric, achieving faster convergence and make the regression more accurate.

## Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU)
The IoU value is computed based on ground-truth box and predicted box. During training model, the cost function is usually optimized to return the best of predicted box and compute IoU to evaluate model. The below  example show that if we calculate $l1-norm$ and $l2-norm$ distance for bounding boxes in cases, the $l_n-norm$ values are exactly the same, but their IoU and GIoU values are very difference. Therefore, there is no strong relation between loss optimization and improving IoU values.

Generalized version of IoU can be directly used as the objective function to optimize in the object detection problem. When IoU does not reflect if two shapes are in vicinity of each other or very far from each other.

$$GIoU = IoU - \frac{\mid C\setminus {(A\cup B)}\mid}{\mid C \mid}$$

Cost function for bounding box regression:

$$L_{GIoU} = 1-GIoU$$
