## Why Probability

Anything that happens in our life is uncertain. There's uncertainty anywhere so whatever you try to do, you need to have some way of dealing or thinking about uncertainty. And the way to do that in a systematic way is using the models that are given to us by **Probability Theory**. So if you're an engineer and you're dealing with some real-world problems. Basically, you're facing noise, noise is random, is uncertain. So, how do you model it? how to you deal with it?

## Notation
