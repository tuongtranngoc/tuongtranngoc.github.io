In the object detection algorithm series, I will brifely give a high-level description of everything you need to know about the implementation of SSD algorithm as described on the [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) paper

## How does SSD works

SSD predict category score and box offsets for a set of default bounding boxes using small convolutional filters applied to feature maps. Detections of different scales was outputed from feature maps of different scales and explicitly separate predictions by aspect ratio.

During training, we need to need to first match the groundtruth to the default bounding boxes and then using those matches to estimate the loss function. During inference time, similar prediction boxes are combined to estimate the final predictions.
