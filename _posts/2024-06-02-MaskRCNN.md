## Introduction

**Instance Segmentation** is a task in Computer Vision. Unlike the *object detection* algorithms, where the goal is to localize and classify individual objects using bounding box, and *semantic segmentation*, where the goal is to classify each pixel into a fixed set of categories without differentiating object instances. 

**Instance Segmentation** requires the correct deection of all objects in an image while also precisely segmenting each instance.
