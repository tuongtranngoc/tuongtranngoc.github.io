## Introduction

Albumentations is a Python library for fast and flexible image augmentations. Albumentations efficiently implements a rich variety of image transform operations that are optimized for performance, and does so while providing a concise, yet powerful image augmentation interface for different computer vision tasks, including object classification, segmentation, and detection.

In the blog, I will provide some samples to apply image augmentations (transformation) in computervision tasks easily.
