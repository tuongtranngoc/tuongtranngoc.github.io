## Introduction

Many people are using the mouse as a tool to switch consoles of tasks, windows, ... in monitoring, programming, and remote servers via SSH.

In the book **tmux 2 - Productive Mouse-Free Development**, the author mentioned that using **tmux** manage multiple terminal sessions in a single window using only your keyboard such as:
+ Manage and run programs side by side in panes
+ Mange a text editor, a database console, and a local web server within a single eviroment.
+ Quickly move between these windows and panes using only the keyboard.

As an AI Engineer, I will use it in mornitoring model training, depolyment, run programs. In this blog, I would like to introduce some of the basic concepts, how to design your tmux using tmux plugin.

## What is Tmux?

**Tmux** is a terminal multiplexer, it enables number of terminals(or windows), each running a seperate program, to be created, accesed, and controlled from single screen.

The key elements to understanding when using tmux effectively.
+ **Session** - the entity that holds one or more windows like Workspace.
+ **Window** - the entity that holds panes in a session. Windows have layouts and can be split into panes.
+ **Panes** - is a pseudoterminal
