Someone accidentally came to my blog ðŸ™ˆ!

## Biography
I am an AI Engineer in the field of machine learning with a focus on computer vision. My research interests include the foundations of algorithms and their real-world applications.
+ **Object Detection/Segmentation/Pose Estimation**
+ **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
+ **Document Intelligence**

I have a background in mathematics and informatics, having graduated from Ha Noi University of Science and Technology (HUST). Since then, I have been deeply engaged in artificial intelligence, constantly expanding my knowledge through work experience.

The blog documents my journey of learning AI from scratch and collections from my life. It will mostly be documenting personal projects I have done for work, school or fun. At the same time, there are discovery trips that I have experienced. 

Whenever I am upset, negative, distracted, I read my blog and remind my self of how far I have gone.
