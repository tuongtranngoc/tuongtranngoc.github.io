Looks like somebody has stumbled upon my blog ðŸ™ˆ!

## Biography
I am an AI Engineer and working at [Kalapa. Jsc](https://kalapa.vn/). Prior to that, I have had the fortune of working at [Eastgate-Software](https://eastgate-software.com/), [VNPT-AI Center](https://icenter.ai/vi) and [iCOMM Media & Tech, Jsc](https://icomm.vn/).

I had graduated from Ha Noi University of Science and Technology (HUST). Since then, I have been deeply engaged in artificial intelligence, constantly expanding my knowledge through work experience.

The blog documents my journey of learning AI from scratch and collections from my life. It will mostly be documenting personal projects I have done for work, school or fun. At the same time, there are discovery trips that I have experienced. 

Whenever I am upset, negative, distracted, I read my blog and remind my self of how far I have gone.
